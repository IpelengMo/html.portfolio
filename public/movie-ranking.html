<h1>Best Series According To Ips</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Series of all-time. </h2>
<hr >
<h3>La Casa De Papel</h3>
<p>This is a true thriller and one of the best really according to me!
    I wish I could experience watching it for the first time again!
    IDK! I don't think I could ever forget this one and it's simply the best in my books!
    Chef's kiss!
</p>
<h3>Lupin</h3>
<p>This is another mind blowing series after money heist that's worth writing home about
    You just keep on pressing next episode while promising yourself that it's the last one before you can sleep or before you can get busy with something.
    IDK Man! I love me some good thriller!
</p>
<h3>The L Word</h3>
<p>Well this was a tough one, but it can take this spot because I believe that representation matters!
    I am Queer and it is a queer series and I believe it's an OG series that was educational for some queer folks in that era before social media and stuff.
